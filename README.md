## Description

A game where a bouncy blob navigates through levels made of floating platforms, featuring both climbable grids and a moving elevator platform to help reach the red goal at the top.

## Interaction Instructions

- Use the up down left right or WASD keys to control the blob movements
- Touching or reading the red box clears the level and auto loads the next one
- Falling off the platform causes blob to "die" and restart level

Example:

> Touch the RED BOX to clear level
> Fall off platform to restart level
